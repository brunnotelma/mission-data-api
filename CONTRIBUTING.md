Contributing
============

Keeping the project small and stable limits our ability to accept new contributors. We are not
seeking new committers at this time, but some small contributions are welcome.

If you've found a security problem, please create an issue in this repo and tag it as [security].

If you've found a bug, please contribute a failing test case so we can study and fix it.

If you have a new feature idea and would like to do it yourself, please fork this repository and add a feature description when you create a pull request. Or, just create an issue in this repo and tag it with [feature-idea].


Code Contributions
------------------

Get working code on a personal branch with tests passing before you submit a PR:

```
./gradlew clean check
```

Please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as
readable as possible.

Contribute code changes through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.
